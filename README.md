I'm Matt and this is my Github page! (technically best-viewed in 2D)

I've long dabbled in the world of tech, but have taken a deep dive into Software Engineering for the last 6 months as a student at App Academy.

Each day I strive to learn something new so I can show you it on here just how cool the world is.
